            <p>
                I have worked in research since 2008. And am currently pursueing an M.S. in the BAIS program
                As such, I am prone to validating and operationalizing data into applicable reporting.
                The National Parks Service API had many query options, with useful output that we could work with.
                After we decided on a reservation concept, I have formated the about page and some of the home page.

            <p>I have experience working as a backend developer as well as some front-end knowledge. I am passionate about learning new and existing technologies, and enjoy solving technical problems. For this Website I contributed backend National Park Service API calls for dynamic content as well as front page banner logic and dynamic elements in Park Search Page, and search scripts. I also contributed parameterized transitions between pages (i.e. search to reservation)</p>

            <p>I am currently working as a Software Engineer at AT&T. I am an avid learner for any new technology especially in the field of analytics, data science, and machine learning. After graduation, I aspire to work as a Data Scientist. 20 years down the line in the future I see myself working as CEO of a big IT company. On this website, I have worked in designing and developing the reservation module for campgrounds.</p>

                <li>The application was developed leveraging data from the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/guides.htm">National Parks API</a></li>
                <li>We created a data model to get data from the API and loaded that data into a SQL Server database</li>
                <li>The application runs in Microsoft Azure as an application service with a backend database</li>
                <li>The application performs all the CRUD operations and allows users to create their reservations and stores them in the database. The user can then view their reservation data, update or delete it</li>
                <li>Application services were written in C# and rely heavily on Razor pages functionality. Each page has its own data model that is passed from the controller</li>
                <li>To not rely on reloading the whole search page when the user searches for parks, we leveraged Ajax functionality for callbacks to our endpoints that asychronously fetches data from the backend database, and creates the results output dynamically using jQuery</li>
                <li>The application follows Code First model which allows us to create all database objects, and their constraints with Entity Framework by creating database classes. The database can then be queried with Linq</li>
                <li>Using dependency injection we created a singleton data loader object that stores pre-mapped chart data when the application starts by calling the NPS API, and paging through all the National Parks available. Since the operation itself takes around 5 seconds we decided to optimize its performance to improve user experience by storing pre-mapped chart data in a singleton</li>
