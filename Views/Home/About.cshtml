            <p>
                I have worked in research since 2008. And am currently pursueing an M.S. in the BAIS program
                As such, I am prone to validating and operationalizing data into applicable reporting.
                The National Parks Service API had many query options, with useful output that we could work with.
                After we decided on a reservation concept, I have formated the about page and some of the home page.

            <p>I have experience working as a backend developer as well as some front-end knowledge. I am passionate about learning new and existing technologies, and enjoy solving technical problems. For this Website I contributed backend National Park Service API calls for dynamic content as well as front page banner logic and dynamic elements in Park Search Page, and search scripts. I also contributed parameterized transitions between pages (i.e. search to reservation)</p>

            <p>I am currently working as a Software Engineer at AT&T. I am an avid learner for any new technology especially in the field of analytics, data science, and machine learning. After graduation, I aspire to work as a Data Scientist. 20 years down the line in the future I see myself working as CEO of a big IT company. On this website, I have worked in designing and developing the reservation module for campgrounds.</p>
