                I have worked in research since 2008. And am currently pursueing an M.S. in the BAIS program
                As such, I am prone to validating and operationalizing data into applicable reporting.
                The National Parks Service API had many query options, with useful output that we could work with.
                After we decided on a reservation concept, I have formated the about page and some of the home page.
